# Sandbox Simulator 2024

**Sandbox Simulator 2024** is a retro-style sandbox game focused on simulating networks. Dive into a world where everything is composed of lists, packets, hosts, and routers, all interacting within a custom scripting language.

## Game Elements

- **Lists**: Containers that hold other elements.
- **Packets**: The entities that flow through the network.
- **Hosts**: Entities that create and consume packets.
- **Routers**: Entities that send and receive packets, routing them to their destinations.

## Features

- **Console-Based Gameplay**: Experience a truly retro environment as the game runs directly on the command line.
- **Custom Scripting Language**: Build and manipulate networks by scripting interactions and behaviors within the game.
- **Dynamic Interactions**: Add complex interactions to network hops, enhancing gameplay and creating unique scenarios.

## Gameplay Examples

### City Network Simulation
Imagine a city where:
- Roads are **routers**.
- Cars are **packets**.
- Stores and houses are **hosts**.

You could script a dynamic event where two cars (packets) on the same road (router) might crash if they meet, introducing randomness and excitement.
Any number of other things can happen in a city. 

### Biological Network Simulation
Consider simulating a biological system:
- A person made of **organs**.
- Organs composed of **tissues**.
- Tissues made up of **cells**.

In this setup, you might create a scenario where a blood cell (packet) is produced by bone marrow (host) and sent to an artery (router) with a random destination.
This would be a small part of the larger simulation. 

### Ecosystem Simulation: Foxes and Rabbits
Imagine an ecosystem where:
- Rabbits are **packets**.
- Foxes are **packets**.
- Meadows and forests are **routers**.
- Burrows and dens are **hosts**.

In this simulation, rabbits (packets) move through meadows and forests (routers) seeking burrows (hosts) for safety.
Meanwhile, foxes (packets) also travel along the same network of paths, hunting for rabbits. 
You could introduce a dynamic where a rabbit packet that encounters a fox packet on the same route might be "eaten," removing the rabbit from the network. 
Many interesting dynamics can arise from a thoroughly crafted ecosystem.
